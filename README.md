# Ghostwheel

I build **Windows-first automation and operator tools** that reduce toil, shrink “alert fatigue,” and make systems easier to run.

## Start here (30-second wins)
- **SizeSpy** — find what’s eating disk space fast (no bloat, built-in Windows tools)
- **Redterm** — a self-logging PowerShell terminal (history + session snapshots for reproducible ops)
- **TheBatchCompendium** — curated batch utilities you actually use in real admin work

> ⭐ If any of these save you time, starring the repo helps me prioritize maintenance and new features.

## What you can expect from my repos
- **Safe defaults** and clear output (built for operators)
- **Minimal dependencies** (portable, practical)
- Designed for **messy real environments**, not perfect labs

## Featured projects
- **TheBatchCompendium** — curated, searchable batch utilities for sysadmins
- **Redterm** — PowerShell terminal with logging + environment snapshots
- **AI-Memory-Persistence** — persistence/sync for AI coding agents across machines
- **SizeSpy** — fast disk usage insights without heavy scanners

## Community
