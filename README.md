# Ghostwheel

Endpoint & DevOps engineer (20+ yrs) focused on Windows automation, reliability, and sysadmin-grade tooling.

### What I build
- Windows-first toolsets that reduce manual ops work and “alert fatigue”
- Repeatable admin workflows (PowerShell-first; pragmatic about Python when it speeds delivery)
- Utilities designed for messy real-world environments and safe defaults

### Current focus
- Endpoint automation & fleet hygiene
- Tooling that compresses operational noise into actionable output
- AI-assisted workflows for scripting, triage, and reproducible ops

### Featured projects
- **TheBatchCompendium** — curated batch utilities for real sysadmin work
- **Redterm** — PowerShell terminal with logging + environment snapshots
- **AI-Memory-Persistence** — persistence/sync for AI coding agents
- **SizeSpy** — fast disk usage insights without bloat

### Principles
Safe defaults • Minimal dependencies • Reproducible workflows • Clear output • Operator trust

If you're building or operating Windows-heavy environments and want less toil and more signal, this is my home base.
